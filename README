MY_KVM
======

Author : gault_r

Usage:
-----
  ./mykvm [OPTIONS] --initrd PATH_TO_INITRD PATH_TO_BZIMAGE KERNEL_OPTIONS

Compiling:
---------
There are 3 levels of debug:
  `make` -> no debug
  `make debug` -> simple debug logs (prints the KVM_EXIT_CODE)
  `make CC=clang debug` -> same as previous plus print content of registers and segment selectors.
                    This option causes the execution to be quite long.

About
-----
  This project uses the KVM api to create and run a virtual machine.
  It does not unable interactions with the os : the linux kernel boots and we get a prompt but
  the keyboard events are not handled.
